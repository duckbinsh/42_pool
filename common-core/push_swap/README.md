# Push Swap Project - 42 Lyon

ðŸš€ Welcome to my Push Swap project repository!

## About

This project is part of the curriculum at 42 Lyon. It involves sorting algorithms to efficiently manipulate two stacks, following strict rules.

## My Implementation

- **Ft_checker**: I've implemented a personal checker to validate the sorting of the stacks.
- **Push Swap**: My solution for sorting algorithms using stack operations.


## How to Use

1. **Compilation**:
   ```powershell
   make
   ```

2. **Usage**;
  - To execute Push Swap:
    ```powershell
     ./push_swap nb1 nb2 nb3 ...
    ```
  - or
    ```powershell
    ARG="nb1 nb2 nb3 ..." ; ./push_swap $ARG
    ```

## Personal Checker
  I've also created a personal checker for additional validation.
  To run it:
  ```powershell
  chmod +x ./ft_checker
  ./ft_checker
  ```
